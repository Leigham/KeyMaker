// KeyMaker v1.0 By Lega, for EpochMod.com with Help of RayMix ! :D 

This Script Is Configurable from Single Coins Or Item/Gold Trading, with anything, set by Classname (i.e ItemBriefcase50oz)
It uses the 4 letter/number code on the Key and the Key Colour to Make a new key with a set price, you can choose which skins give the scroll wheel option via the configfile. 
You can choose the price whether it be Single Coin or Gold. 
Debug mode is there , Incase you run into problems, again in the configs

//Plans 

Bring in an option to give Keys free, (not reccommended, but still an option).
To make a Mechanic that comes to you on the right click of as radio, and if you kill him, he spawns a group around you with configurable skills/weapons, to hunt you down. 


//Installation Instructions.

1, Extract the Custom Folder, into your root Directory so its in the same folder as your Init.sqf and Description.ext so it should be custom\Keymaker\Files here. 


2,  Open Your Init.sqf, and right at the BOTTOM, put 

			execvm "custom\Keymaker\createkey_init.sqf";
			
3, Defines, If you do not already have a defines, Copy the Scripts folder into the root of your directory. 
scripts\defines\Defines.hpp
Again if you dont already have them, include the below in your Description.ext.
			
			#include "scripts\defines\defines.hpp"
			

4,Make sure to include the Keymaking Dialog to your description.
			
			#include "custom\keymaker\keymaker.hpp"
			
to the bottom of your description.ext

5, open the file VariableEdits.sqf, and copy everything to somewhere near the top of your variables, under disableSerialization; and if you have single coins, under that too.
 
6, copy what is in the fn_selfactions edit, to the verybottom of your fn_selfactions file. 

7, If you want to stop the spam coming from unkown variable s_maker_dialog add    CTRL+ in your editor and search for dayz_resetSelfActions = {  paste it just below.


						s_maker_dialog = -1;
						
						
to the reset self actions part of your variables.sqf.

8, To make all this easier, you should be using either Notepad++ or Atom. they both have SEARCH functions to make things easier by CTRL+F 

9. Configure the part at the top of your variable, and start the server.
